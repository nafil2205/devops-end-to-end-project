# DevOps End-to-End Project

This project demonstrates a complete DevOps lifecycle using:
- Git & GitHub
- AWS
- Terraform
- Ansible
- Docker
- CI/CD
- Prometheus & Grafana

This repository will be built step by step.

## Troubleshooting & Lessons Learned

- Git does not track empty directories by default.
- Empty project folders were not visible on GitHub until a .gitkeep file was added.
- Ensured all work was done inside the Git repository directory containing the .git folder.
- Verified file tracking using git status, ls -a, and pwd.

This helped reinforce proper Git repository structure and version control best practices.
