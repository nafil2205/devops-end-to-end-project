## Day 1 DevOps End-to-End Project

This project demonstrates a complete DevOps lifecycle using:
- Git & GitHub
- AWS
- Terraform
- Ansible
- Docker
- CI/CD
- Prometheus & Grafana

This repository will be built step by step.

## Troubleshooting & Lessons Learned

- Git does not track empty directories by default.
- Empty project folders were not visible on GitHub until a .gitkeep file was added.
- Ensured all work was done inside the Git repository directory containing the .git folder.
- Verified file tracking using git status, ls -a, and pwd.

This helped reinforce proper Git repository structure and version control best practices.

## Day 2 – AWS EC2 and Apache Web Server Setup

### Objective
Launch an EC2 instance on AWS and deploy an Apache web server.

### Web Access Verification
The Apache default test page was accessed successfully using the EC2
public IP address through a web browser.validate compute, networking, and basic server configuration.

### EC2 Instance Setup
An EC2 instance was launched using Amazon Linux with a t3.micro
instance type. A key pair was created for secure SSH access, and a
security group was configured to allow SSH (port 22) and HTTP
(port 80) traffic Custom Tcp (port 3000) and Custom TCP (Port 9090).

### SSH Access
The EC2 instance was accessed securely using SSH and a PEM key file,
confirming successful connectivity to the server.

### Apache Web Server Installation
Apache HTTP Server was installed, started, and enabled to run on
system startup.

```bash
sudo yum install httpd -y
sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl enable httpd
```

### Service Validation
The Apache service status was verified, and it was confirmed that the
server was listening on port 80.

```
bash
sudo systemctl status httpd
sudo netstat -tulnp | grep 80
```

### Web Access Verification
The Apache default test page was accessed successfully using the EC2
public IP address through a web browser.
